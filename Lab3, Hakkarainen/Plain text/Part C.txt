When she fell she fell apart.
Cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated as a child with sidewalk chalk.
When she crashed, her clothes disintegrated and blew away with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends.
When she looked around, her skin was spattered with ink
forming the words of a thousand voices, echoes she heard even in her sleep.:
"Whatever you say, it is not right."
"Whatever you do, it is not enough."
"Your kindness is fake."
"Your pain is manipulative."
